#Your friends just showed up! 
#Given the following array of names, use a for loop to greet each friend individually.

friends = ['Sarah', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Dave']

for i in friends
    puts "Hey, how are you doing! #{i}"
end

#for loops are not used often in ruby but .times is and .each is and .map is
