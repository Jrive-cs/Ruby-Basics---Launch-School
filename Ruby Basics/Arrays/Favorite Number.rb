#The following array contains three names and numbers. Group each name with the number following it by placing the pair in their own array. 
#Then create a nested array containing all three groups. 
#What does this look like? (You don't need to write any code here. Just alter the value shown so it meets the exercise requirements.)

favorites = [ ['Dave', 7],['Miranda', 3],['Jason', 11] ]

print favorites.flatten

#Flatten will remove all the sub arrays when used on a multidimensional array.
#The flatten output will flatten the multidimensional array so the sub arrays do
#not show on the output.
